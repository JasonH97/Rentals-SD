Interested in moving to San Diego? I am moving back there soon and wrote these one-off, halfassed scripts to help the process along. I handpicked cities in the area I am interested in living in, and using POST requests query zillow and apartments.com for potential places to live. I am sure there are a million ways to improve these, and I will the next time I plan a major move.
